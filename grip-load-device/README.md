#### For Students:
This repo contains the code, documentation, and parts for this device. The data collection is done on LabVIEW. Videos explaining how to download code, how arduino & LabVIEW code works, and how run the code can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc3eWZpUKAzyQBUwwpyzYRb3LxGoiJ5aO ).
