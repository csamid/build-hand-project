# GRIP LOAD DEVICE
The grip-load device (GLD) runs on a arduino uno which reads data from 3 sensors. A MPU6050 for acceleration which is used to obtain load force during the dynamic test. A LCFD-50 load cell to acquire grip force. Finally, a LSB302 Futek load cell to get load force during the static tests. The purpose of this device is to assess the differences in grip force to load force coordination between health and hand impaired individuals. We also hope this device can be used for rehabilitive training of individuals with hand impairment.
